# Bayesian AnalysisiBinomial_Beta_Model

In 2013 a polling company wished to assess the rate of support for a proposed government bill to introduce a local property tax. To do this, the polling company randomly sampled 100 individuals at random and asked them to answer the question: Do you support the introduction of a local property tax? Yes or No. Of the 100 individual sampled, 32 answered Yes and 68 answered No.
Of primary interest is to assess the uncertainty in, theta_1, the probability that an individual supports this bill.
